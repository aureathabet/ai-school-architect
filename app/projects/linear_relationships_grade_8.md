# Lesson Plan for Grade 8: Understanding Linear Relationships

## Introduction to Linear Relationships

Linear relationships are an essential component of algebra that help us understand how two variables can relate to each other in a predictable way. In this lesson, we'll explore the concepts of linear relationships, how to recognize them, and how to represent them using equations and graphs.

### Objectives
1. Understand the definition of a linear relationship.
2. Learn how to express a linear relationship using the slope-intercept form of a line.
3. Learn how to graph linear equations on a coordinate plane.
4. Apply linear relationships to solve real-world problems.

## Lesson Outline

### 1. What is a Linear Relationship?

A linear relationship is a relationship between two variables where the rate of change is constant. This means that if you were to graph these variables on a coordinate plane, they would form a straight line.

#### Key Focus Points:
- **Definition**: A relationship with a constant rate of change.
- **Graphical Representation**: A straight line on a graph.
- **Proportional Change**: As one variable changes, the other changes at a consistent rate.

### 2. Mathematical Representation of Linear Relationships

Linear relationships can be expressed using the equation of a line, known as the slope-intercept form:

\[ y = mx + b \]

#### Key Focus Points:
- **y**: Dependent variable (output).
- **x**: Independent variable (input).
- **m**: Slope of the line, representing the rate of change.
- **b**: y-intercept, the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

### 3. Understanding Slope and Y-Intercept

#### **Slope (\(m\))**:
- Represents how steep the line is.
- A positive slope means the line rises from left to right.
- A negative slope means the line falls from left to right.

#### **Y-Intercept (\(b\))**:
- The value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\).
- It tells us where the line crosses the y-axis.

### 4. Graphing Linear Equations

To graph a linear equation, follow these steps:
1. Start by plotting the y-intercept (\(b\)) on the y-axis.
2. Use the slope (\(m\)) to find another point. For example, if \(m = \frac{3}{2}\), move up 3 units and right 2 units from the y-intercept.
3. Draw a straight line through the points.

### 5. Real-World Applications of Linear Relationships

Linear relationships are not just theoretical—they appear in everyday life. Here are some examples:

- **Financial Planning**: Calculating simple interest over time.
- **Travel**: Understanding speed and distance relationships.

### Sample Problems

#### Example 1: Simple Problem

**Problem**: A car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h. Write an equation that represents the distance (\(d\)) in terms of time (\(t\)).

**Solution**:
1. Recognize the linear relationship: Distance = Speed × Time.
2. \(d = 60t\), where \(d\) is the distance and \(t\) is the time in hours.
3. The slope \(m\) is 60 (the speed).

This is a direct proportionality since the line passes through the origin (0,0).

#### Example 2: More Complex Problem

**Problem**: A cell phone plan costs $30 per month plus $0.10 per text message. Write an equation for the total monthly cost (\(C\)) in terms of the number of text messages (\(n\)).

**Solution**:
1. The fixed cost (y-intercept) is $30.
2. The variable cost per message (slope) is $0.10.
3. Equation: \(C = 0.10n + 30\).

To find the cost for 100 text messages:
\[ C = 0.10 \times 100 + 30 = 10 + 30 = 40 \]
The total cost would be $40.

4. Calculate the total cost for 50 text messages using the equation \(C = 0.10n + 20\).
5. If a line passes through the points (0, 3) and (2, 7), find the slope.

### Medium Exercises
6. A train travels 80 km in the first hour and continues at the same speed. Write an equation representing the distance traveled (\(d\)) over time (\(t\)).
7. Graph the equation \(y = \frac{1}{2}x - 4\) and identify two points on the line.
8. If the cost to rent a bike is given by \(C = 15h + 5\), where \(h\) is the number of hours, find the cost for 3 hours.
