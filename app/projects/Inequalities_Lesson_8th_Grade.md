# Lesson Plan: Inequalities

## Objective:
Students will understand and solve linear inequalities in one variable, graph the solutions on a number line, and apply these skills to real-world scenarios.

## Materials:
- Whiteboard and markers
- Graph paper
- Rulers
- Projector and screen
- Worksheets with practice problems

## Lesson Duration:
1 hour

## Lesson Outline:

1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Begin with a brief discussion on what inequalities are and how they differ from equations.
   - Explain the symbols: >, <, ≥, ≤.

2. **Direct Instruction (15 minutes)**
   - Demonstrate how to solve basic inequalities (e.g., x + 5 > 7).
   - Explain the properties of inequalities (e.g., adding or subtracting the same number from both sides).
   - Introduce the concept of reversing the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.

3. **Guided Practice (15 minutes)**
   - Solve a few examples together as a class. Example: 
     - Solve 3x - 4 < 11.
     - Solve -2x + 3 ≥ 5.
   - Graph these solutions on a number line.

4. **Independent Practice (15 minutes)**
   - Provide students with a worksheet containing various inequalities to solve and graph.
   - Circulate the classroom to provide assistance as needed.

5. **Real-World Application (5 minutes)**
   - Discuss a real-world scenario where inequalities are used, such as budgeting or measuring ingredients for a recipe.

6. **Conclusion (5 minutes)**
   - Review key concepts of the lesson.
   - Answer any remaining questions from students.

# Quiz: Inequalities

## Instructions:
Solve the following inequalities and graph the solution on a number line.

1. Solve and graph: x + 7 < 12

2. Solve and graph: 2x - 3 ≥ 9

3. Solve and graph: -4x > 16

4. Solve and graph: 5 - 3x ≤ 2

5. A real-world problem:  
   Sarah has $50 to spend on books. Each book costs $8. Write and solve an inequality to determine how many books Sarah can buy.

## Answers:
1. x + 7 < 12  
   Solution: x < 5  
   Graph: Open circle on 5, arrow pointing to the left.

2. 2x - 3 ≥ 9  
   Solution: x ≥ 6  
   Graph: Closed circle on 6, arrow pointing to the right.

3. -4x > 16  
   Solution: x < -4  
   Graph: Open circle on -4, arrow pointing to the left.

4. 5 - 3x ≤ 2  
   Solution: x ≥ 1  
   Graph: Closed circle on 1, arrow pointing to the right.

5. 8b ≤ 50  
   Solution: b ≤ 6.25  
   Since Sarah can only buy whole books, she can buy at most 6 books.
